1. Analyze code paths for performance bottlenecks.
2. Suggest and implement optimizations that preserve existing behavior.
3. Ensure optimizations follow `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
4. Run performance profiling and compare before/after metrics.
5. Validate functionality with all tests passing.
6. Provide a report on changes and performance gains.
