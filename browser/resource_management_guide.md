# Browser Resource Management Implementation Guide

## Problem Summary
The agent was opening excessive tabs (30+ as shown in screenshot), creating significant resource waste by:
- Opening new tabs for every search instead of reusing existing search tabs
- Creating multiple tabs for the same email service (Tuta, ProtonMail, etc.)
- Never closing unnecessary tabs
- Following system prompt instruction to "open new tab for research"

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt (✅ COMPLETED)
**File:** `agent/system_prompt.md`
- **REMOVED**: "If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one"
- **ADDED**: Comprehensive resource-conscious browsing rules
- **NEW RULES**:
  - Conservative tab creation philosophy
  - Service continuity (one tab per service)
  - Research efficiency (reuse search tabs)
  - Clear guidelines on when new tabs are appropriate vs forbidden

### 2. Smart Search Implementation (✅ COMPLETED)
**File:** `controller/service.py`
- **Enhanced `search_google` action**:
  - Reuses current tab if already on Google
  - Reuses existing Google search tabs instead of creating new ones
  - Only creates new tab if no Google search tab exists
- **Result**: Prevents multiple Google search tabs

### 3. Intelligent Navigation (✅ COMPLETED)
**File:** `controller/service.py`
- **Enhanced `go_to_url` action**:
  - Detects email service from URL (ProtonMail, Tuta, Gmail, etc.)
  - Reuses existing tab for the same service instead of creating new one
  - Updated action description to discourage unnecessary new tabs
- **Added `_extract_service_name()` helper method**
- **Result**: One tab per email service maximum

### 4. Tab Cleanup Action (✅ COMPLETED)
**File:** `controller/service.py`
- **New `cleanup_tabs` action**:
  - Closes duplicate service tabs
  - Removes excess Google search tabs (keeps max 1)
  - Closes empty/new tab pages
  - Provides feedback on tabs closed
- **Result**: Agent can actively manage browser resources

## Expected Impact

### Before Implementation:
- 30+ tabs open (as shown in screenshot)
- Multiple tabs for same service (Tuta, ProtonMail)
- Multiple Google search tabs
- Continuous tab accumulation

### After Implementation:
- **Maximum 5-8 tabs** for typical tasks
- **One tab per email service** (ProtonMail, Tuta, etc.)
- **One Google search tab** (reused for all searches)
- **Active cleanup** when tabs accumulate
- **Resource warnings** in agent memory

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Basic Tab Management
```bash
python tests/test1.py
```
**Expected behavior:**
- Agent reuses Google search tabs instead of creating new ones
- Agent reuses service tabs (if it visits Tuta twice, same tab)
- Much lower final tab count (5-8 vs 30+)

### Test 2: Resource Monitoring
Look for these log messages:
- `"Searched for X in Google (reused tab)"` - Good, reusing search tabs
- `"Navigated to X (reused existing Y tab)"` - Good, reusing service tabs
- `"Cleaned up X unnecessary tabs"` - Good, active resource management

### Test 3: Manual Verification
Watch browser during agent execution:
- Should see tab reuse instead of constant new tab creation
- Should see occasional tab cleanup actions
- Should maintain reasonable tab count throughout task

## Advanced Features Available

### Browser Resource Manager (Optional)
**File:** `browser/resource_manager.py`
- Complete tab lifecycle management
- Purpose-based tab categorization
- Automatic cleanup recommendations
- Resource usage monitoring

**To enable:**
1. Import BrowserResourceManager in agent service
2. Track tab purposes and usage
3. Get cleanup recommendations
4. Integrate with decision making

### Enhanced Memory Context (Optional)
- Track which services have been attempted vs just researched
- Provide resource usage context in agent memory
- Guide decision making based on tab status

## Monitoring Success

### Key Metrics:
1. **Tab Count**: Should stay under 8-10 for typical tasks
2. **Service Tab Duplication**: Should be zero (one tab per service)
3. **Search Tab Efficiency**: Should reuse existing Google search tabs
4. **Resource Messages**: Should see "reused tab" messages in logs

### Warning Signs:
❌ Multiple tabs for same service (Tuta, ProtonMail)
❌ Excessive Google search tabs (>2)
❌ Continuously growing tab count
❌ Memory overload warnings correlating with tab count

### Success Indicators:
✅ "reused tab" messages in logs
✅ Stable tab count throughout task
✅ One tab per email service
✅ Single Google search tab being reused
✅ Occasional cleanup actions

## Additional Recommendations

### For Production Use:
1. **Monitor tab count metrics** in telemetry
2. **Set tab count alerts** if exceeding 15 tabs
3. **Track resource reuse ratio** (reused vs new tabs)
4. **Consider browser memory limits** in agent settings

### For Further Enhancement:
1. **Visual tab counter** in agent status
2. **Automatic cleanup triggers** at tab count thresholds
3. **Service-specific tab strategies** for different website types
4. **Integration with system resource monitoring**

The implemented changes directly address the wasteful browser behavior shown in the screenshot and should result in dramatically improved resource management.
