    print("🚨 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:")
    print("Agent was claiming 'Successfully uploaded' when no actual upload occurred!")
    print()

    print("📋 MISLEADING LOGS (Before Fix):")
    print("   INFO: The previous action successfully uploaded the file")
    print("   INFO: Uploaded the logo file to the designated upload field")
    print("   INFO: Successfully visited URL and uploaded the logo file")
    print("   BUT: No actual upload happened - just file selection!")
    print()

    print("🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:")
    print("   The upload_file method was returning success=True even when:")
    print("   ❌ File was only selected in input element (cnt > 0)")
    print("   ❌ No UI confirmation of actual upload (confirmed = False)")
    print("   ❌ No server-side upload verification")
    print("   ❌ Agent interpreted file selection as upload completion")
    print()

    print("⚙️  CODE CHANGES MADE:")
    print("   1. Changed success criteria in controller/service.py:")
    print("      BEFORE: success=True (even without confirmation)")
    print("      AFTER:  success=False (unless confirmed via UI)")
    print()
    print("   2. Updated messages and logging:")
    print("      BEFORE: 'File selected but upload success not visually confirmed' (INFO)")
    print("      AFTER:  'File selected but upload NOT confirmed - may need additional steps' (WARNING)")
    print()
    print("   3. Fixed ActionResult success flag:")
    print("      BEFORE: success=True  # Still consider success if files are present")
    print("      AFTER:  success=False # Do not claim success without confirmation")
    print()

    print("✅ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW:")
    print("   🎯 success=True: Only when upload is confirmed via UI feedback")
    print("   🎯 success=False: When file selected but upload not confirmed")
    print("   🎯 WARNING logs: Clear indication of uncertainty")
    print("   🎯 Honest feedback: Agent knows upload status is uncertain")
    print()

    print("🎉 IMPACT:")
    print("   ✅ No more false 'Successfully uploaded' claims")
    print("   ✅ Agent can take appropriate follow-up actions")
    print("   ✅ Users get accurate status information")
    print("   ✅ Better debugging when uploads actually fail")
    print("   ✅ Trustworthy automation behavior")
    print()

    print("🧪 TO TEST:")
    print("   Run any upload task and check logs for honest feedback")
    print("   Upload actions should now clearly distinguish:")
    print("   - File selection (uncertain success)")
    print("   - Confirmed upload (true success)")
