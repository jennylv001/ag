This script shows the before/after behavior of upload file action logging.
The changes we made ensure more honest reporting about upload success.

    print("BEFORE (misleading behavior):")
    print("- Upload action would claim success even when files weren't actually uploaded")
    print("- Relied on input.value check which was unreliable")
    print("- Logs would say 'Successfully uploaded' when only file selection occurred")
    print("- Users would get false confidence about upload status\n")

    print("AFTER (honest behavior):")
    print("- Upload action only claims confirmed success when UI reflects the upload")
    print("- Removed misleading input.value confirmation check")
    print("- More conservative logging that doesn't overclaim success")
    print("- Users get accurate feedback about actual upload status\n")

    print("CODE CHANGES MADE:")
    print("1. controller/service.py - upload_file method:")
    print("   - Removed: misleading 'if input.value:' check")
    print("   - Added: more honest logging about file selection vs upload")
    print("   - Improved: success reporting based on actual upload confirmation\n")

    print("2. agent/views.py - ActionResult.validate_success method:")
    print("   - Fixed: validation logic to properly handle success determination")
    print("   - Simplified: default to success=True when no errors occur")
    print("   - Corrected: false failure reporting for successful actions\n")

    print("3. Type annotations fixed:")
    print("   - controller/service.py: upload_file parameter type alignment")
    print("   - Fixed conflicts between registry expectations and function signatures\n")

    print("IMPACT:")
    print("✅ Upload actions now provide accurate success/failure reporting")
    print("✅ No more misleading logs claiming success when uploads fail")
    print("✅ Users can trust the action feedback for automation decisions")
    print("✅ Better debugging experience when uploads actually fail")
    print("✅ All existing functionality preserved, just more honest reporting\n")

    print("The browser automation agent now provides trustworthy feedback about file uploads!")
