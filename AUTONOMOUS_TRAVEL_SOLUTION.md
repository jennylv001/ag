# Autonomous Long-Running Agent Solution for Travel/Unattended Operation

## Problem You Identified

Your agent was **stopping at checkpoints** after failures instead of **continuing autonomously**. This meant:
- ❌ Agent would fail on a task and just wait passively
- ❌ No use for travel/unattended scenarios
- ❌ Required manual intervention to restart

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Autonomous Continuation Logic**
Added intelligent recovery that **automatically continues** after failures:

```python
# New setting in AgentSettings:
long_running_enable_autonomous_continuation: bool = True

# Autonomous recovery process:
1. Failure occurs → Create checkpoint
2. Analyze failure pattern
3. Execute recovery strategy (restart browser, clear cache, etc.)
4. Wait appropriate delay (3-15 seconds based on failure type)
5. Signal supervisor to continue with new approach
6. Agent resumes autonomously
```

### 2. **Recovery Strategies**
Intelligent failure-specific recovery:

- **Browser crashes** → Restart browser session + continue
- **Memory issues** → Clear caches + restart components
- **Timeouts** → Increase timeout settings + retry
- **LLM failures** → Switch to backup LLM provider
- **Network issues** → Wait + retry with backoff

### 3. **Escalation Protection**
Prevents infinite failure loops:

```python
long_running_max_consecutive_failures: int = 5  # Stop after 5 consecutive failures
long_running_failure_escalation_delay: float = 300.0  # 5 minutes between escalations
```

### 4. **Supervisor Integration**
Enhanced supervisor to handle autonomous continuation events:

```python
# Events flow:
Long-Running Mode → Recovery → Continuation Event → Supervisor → Resume Operation
```

## How It Works for Travel Scenarios

### **Before (Your Issue):**
```
Task fails → Create checkpoint → Wait passively → Manual intervention needed
```

### **After (Autonomous Operation):**
```
Task fails → Create checkpoint → Analyze failure → Execute recovery →
Continue autonomously → Keep trying until success or max failures reached
```

## Travel Configuration Example

```python
# Perfect for travel/unattended operation
travel_settings = AgentSettings(
    enable_long_running_mode=True,
    long_running_enable_autonomous_continuation=True,  # KEY SETTING
    long_running_max_consecutive_failures=10,  # Very tolerant
    long_running_checkpoint_interval=60.0,  # Checkpoint every minute
    long_running_monitoring_interval=10.0,  # Frequent health checks
    long_running_enable_auto_recovery=True,
)

agent = Agent(
    task="Monitor job postings every hour and save interesting ones",
    settings=travel_settings
)

# This will now run autonomously, recovering from failures!
await agent.run()
```

## Real-World Travel Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Browser Crash While You're on a Plane**
- ✅ Agent detects browser crash
- ✅ Creates recovery checkpoint
- ✅ Restarts browser session
- ✅ Continues monitoring job postings
- ✅ **No manual intervention needed**

### **Scenario 2: Network Timeout in Hotel WiFi**
- ✅ Agent detects network timeout
- ✅ Increases timeout settings
- ✅ Retries with exponential backoff
- ✅ Continues operation when network stabilizes
- ✅ **Keeps working despite poor WiFi**

### **Scenario 3: Website Changes Structure**
- ✅ Agent detects element not found errors
- ✅ Creates checkpoint of last working state
- ✅ Tries alternative approaches
- ✅ Adapts to website changes
- ✅ **Self-healing operation**

## Key Benefits for Travel

1. **🚁 Autonomous Operation** - Runs without you for days/weeks
2. **🔄 Self-Healing** - Recovers from common failures automatically
3. **📊 Detailed Logging** - Know what happened while you were away
4. **💾 Frequent Checkpoints** - Never lose progress
5. **🛑 Safe Termination** - Still responds to Ctrl+C when you return

## Usage

```python
# Run the example
python autonomous_travel_agent.py

# Choose option 1 for single autonomous task
# Choose option 2 for multiple concurrent autonomous tasks

# The agent will now continue running even through failures!
```

## Monitoring While Away

The agent logs all autonomous recoveries:

```
INFO [browser_use.agent.long_running_mode] Autonomous continuation starting in 10s with strategy: restart_browser_session
INFO [browser_use.agent.supervisor] Autonomous continuation triggered with recovery action: restart_browser_session
INFO [browser_use.agent.supervisor] Agent in terminal state, attempting autonomous restart
INFO [browser_use.agent.supervisor] Autonomous continuation planning request submitted
```

This gives you full visibility into what happened while you were traveling!

## Summary

**Before:** Agent stops at first failure → Manual restart needed → Useless for travel
**After:** Agent automatically recovers from failures → Continues autonomously → Perfect for travel

Your agent can now **truly run unattended** while you're traveling! 🌍✈️
