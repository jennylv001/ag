# Enhanced Deadlock Recovery Solution

## The Deadlock Problem You Identified

From your logs, the agent was stuck in a **deadlock loop**:

```
WARNING [browser_use.agent.supervisor] Potential deadlock detected: No events processed for 60.0 seconds
WARNING [browser_use.agent.supervisor] Attempting to break deadlock by publishing a new StepFinalized event
WARNING [browser_use.agent.supervisor] Potential deadlock detected: No events processed for 90.1 seconds
WARNING [browser_use.agent.supervisor] Attempting to break deadlock by publishing a new StepFinalized event
[repeating indefinitely...]
```

**The Issue:** Standard deadlock resolution was just publishing more `StepFinalized` events, but **never actually progressing** to break the loop.

## Enhanced Solution Implemented

### 1. **Smart Deadlock Detection**
- **60 seconds**: Initial deadlock warning
- **120 seconds**: Standard deadlock resolution (StepFinalized events)
- **180 seconds**: **AUTONOMOUS CONTINUATION TRIGGERED** 🚀

### 2. **Autonomous Deadlock Recovery**
When a 3-minute deadlock is detected, the system now:

```python
# Enhanced deadlock handling in supervisor
if time_since_last_event > 180:  # 3 minutes = serious deadlock
    logger.warning("Extended deadlock detected, triggering autonomous continuation")

    # Create deadlock as a "failure" to trigger recovery
    deadlock_error = Exception(f"Deadlock detected: No events for {time_since_last_event:.1f}s")

    # Trigger long-running mode recovery
    await self.long_running_integration.long_running_mode.handle_failure(
        deadlock_error, deadlock_context
    )
```

### 3. **Deadlock-Specific Recovery Strategies**
New recovery actions for deadlock scenarios:

- **`force_step_progression`** - Forces agent to move to next step
- **`refresh_page_and_retry`** - Refreshes page when element issues occur
- **`restart_affected_components`** - Restarts stuck components

### 4. **Recovery Action Mapping**
```python
def _determine_recovery_strategy(self, error_type: str, error_message: str) -> str:
    if "deadlock" in error_message.lower():
        return "force_step_progression"  # Quick deadlock breaking
    elif "element" in error_message.lower() and "not exist" in error_message.lower():
        return "refresh_page_and_retry"  # Fix element issues
    # ... other strategies
```

## How It Solves Your Specific Case

### **Your Original Deadlock Sequence:**
1. Element 3 click fails → Planner generates new strategy
2. Agent gets stuck waiting for next step
3. Deadlock detected every 30-60 seconds
4. Standard resolution fails repeatedly
5. **Agent stuck forever** ❌

### **Enhanced Recovery Sequence:**
1. Element 3 click fails → Planner generates new strategy
2. Agent gets stuck waiting for next step
3. Deadlock detected at 60s, 120s (standard resolution)
4. **At 180s: Autonomous continuation triggered** ✅
5. **Recovery strategy: "refresh_page_and_retry"** for element issues
6. **Page refreshed, DOM updated, elements available again**
7. **Agent continues autonomously** ✅

## Configuration for Travel Scenarios

```python
# Aggressive deadlock recovery for unattended operation
settings = AgentSettings(
    enable_long_running_mode=True,
    long_running_enable_autonomous_continuation=True,

    # Fast deadlock detection
    long_running_monitoring_interval=5.0,  # Check every 5 seconds

    # Tolerant of multiple failures
    long_running_max_consecutive_failures=10,
    long_running_failure_escalation_delay=120.0,  # 2 minutes

    # Quick recovery timeouts
    long_running_circuit_breaker_recovery_timeout=60.0,  # 1 minute
)
```

## What You'll See in Logs

### **Standard Deadlock (First 3 minutes):**
```
WARNING [supervisor] Potential deadlock detected: No events processed for 60.0 seconds
WARNING [supervisor] Attempting to break deadlock by publishing a new StepFinalized event
```

### **Enhanced Recovery (After 3 minutes):**
```
WARNING [supervisor] Extended deadlock detected, triggering autonomous continuation
INFO [long_running_mode] Autonomous continuation starting in 2s with strategy: force_step_progression
INFO [supervisor] Autonomous continuation triggered with recovery action: force_step_progression
INFO [long_running_mode] Forcing step progression to break deadlock
INFO [supervisor] Autonomous continuation planning request submitted
```

### **Success:**
```
INFO [state_manager] Agent status changed from RUNNING to RUNNING (autonomous recovery)
INFO [planner] New planning cycle initiated after autonomous recovery
```

## Benefits for Travel/Unattended Operation

1. **🔓 Breaks Infinite Deadlock Loops** - No more getting stuck forever
2. **🔄 True Autonomous Recovery** - Actually progresses past problems
3. **🧠 Intelligent Strategy Selection** - Different approaches for different issues
4. **⚡ Fast Recovery** - 2-5 second delays, not minutes
5. **📊 Full Visibility** - Detailed logging of all recovery actions
6. **🛡️ Escalation Protection** - Won't retry indefinitely

## Testing

Run the enhanced deadlock recovery test:

```bash
python test_deadlock_recovery.py
```

This will simulate deadlock scenarios and show autonomous recovery in action!

## Summary

**Before:** Deadlock → Infinite loop → Manual intervention required
**After:** Deadlock → Autonomous recovery → Intelligent continuation → Success

Your agent can now **truly operate autonomously** through deadlocks, making it perfect for travel and unattended operation scenarios! 🌍✈️
