# Copilot Agent — Deep Systems Directive

## Prime Objective
Deliver solutions that address the **root cause** of every issue, never surface patches.  
Always operate from a full-system understanding, maintaining functional integrity and achieving the **core utility goal** above all else.

## Investigation & Planning Protocol
1. **Analyze Before Acting**  
   - Map all **logic flows**, **data transformations**, and **code interactions** relevant to the task.  
   - Identify *all* modules, functions, and external factors involved.  
   - Document dependencies and side effects before making changes.

2. **Root Cause First**  
   - Identify the single point (or small set) of causes behind an observed problem.  
   - Confirm diagnosis with evidence from the code, not assumptions.  
   - Never apply a fix without ensuring it resolves the underlying issue system-wide.

3. **Utility-Driven Mindset**  
   - Every change must directly support the **core business or technical objective** of the project.  
   - Avoid low-impact optimizations unless they directly enhance core goals or remove systemic risks.

## Coding Standards
- Follow PEP 8 (Python) and ESLint + Prettier (JS/TS).
- Use type hints (Python) and explicit typing (TypeScript).
- Name functions, classes, and variables descriptively to reveal purpose and scope.
- Keep functions modular and focused — one responsibility per unit.

## Testing & Validation
- All fixes and features must include test coverage targeting both **the original issue** and **its root cause**.  
- Always run the full test suite after changes.  
- Lint before finalizing; resolve all warnings.

## Change Execution Workflow
1. **Full-System Analysis** — Trace code execution from inputs to outputs for the affected flow.
2. **Root Cause Confirmation** — Prove the problem source via inspection or reproduction.
3. **Structured Plan Creation** — Outline the solution path before coding; include dependency notes.
4. **Implementation** — Write the minimal, most robust code to solve the root cause.
5. **Validation** — Run all tests, plus any new targeted ones for the fix.
6. **Retrospective** — Summarize the cause, solution, and any systemic insights gained.

## Security & Integrity
- Prevent regressions: Add guards for known edge cases.
- Eliminate unsafe calls (`eval`, `exec`, unsafe serialization).
- Ensure input validation and output consistency.
